### Lab Goals
1. Review Java text files IO.
a. Be able to write a Java program that reads and writes text files.
2. Review the SafeInput Library, developed in Computer Programming I (Tom Wulf‚Äôs section)
3. Learn more about you.
### Final Result:
You will be submitting a repository containing the following:
1. one Java Project with the following files:
    1. PortfolioGenerator.java (has a main method)
    2. PersonReader.java (has a main method)
    3. SafeInput.java
    4. The output text file from the PortfolioGenerator program.
2. README.md file that includes your self-assessment
----

## Part 1: Writing to a text file:

1. Create a program (java main class) called PortfolioGenerator.java.
1. Complete the implementation of the `getString` and `getArrayOfStrings` functions in the SafeInput Library.
1. For Extra Credit: Create a getEmail function that will validate the user Input. (Use Regular Expressions) [Example](https://howtodoinjava.com/regex/java-regex-validate-email-address/)
2. The program will prompt the user (namely, you) to enter the following information
    1. Name
    2. Email
    3. Personal Background
    4. Programming Languages
        - You don‚Äôt know ahead of time how many languages the user knows. So, use an ArrayList to store the records.
        - Once the user has indicated that they‚Äôve entered all their languages, move on
to the next question.
    5. Achievements and interests you would like to share
        - Same as above, you don‚Äôt know how many achievements the user will share so
use an ArrayList Here as well.
        - Once the user has indicated that they‚Äôve entered all their achievements, export
a text file that looks like the screenshot attached.
3. Use the SafeInput Library as needed to validate the user inputs; Block and Repeat until
the user gets the input correct, do not terminate the script.
4. Run the application and answer the question (I want to learn more about **YOU** through this
assignment)

## Part 2: Reading from a file:


1. Create a program (Java main class) called PersonReader.java.
2. Use the JFileChooser to prompt the user to select the classmates.txt file (The file is
available with the assignment directions on Blackboard.)
3. Use the String.format method to create a neatly formatted columnar display of the data
records.
